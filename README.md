This project involves the analysis of an art database to identify the most and least expensive paintings, along with details about the artists and museums where they are placed and many more. 
The database consists of tables such as artists, work, product_size, and museum.
By considering this Dataset, I have tried my best to analyze the data and answer some of the key questions using Structured Query Language and using MySQL Workbench as my Primary GUI. 
The SQL Problems in this project have been created by techTFQ and he has used PostreSQL to answer the queries. 
Here I have put my own spin on the same dataset and have used MySQL to answer the same problems.

Description of Folders: 

Dataset Folder: 
All the relevant data is under the datasets folder. This data has been taken from Kaggle website.
Link to Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/famous-paintings

The relevant SQL questions has been taken from the techTFQ youtube channel.

I have also added the list of problems as a seperate file as well for reference.

Scripts Folder: 
A Python Script has been added which is used to convert CSV data into SQL Data. 
This step is crucial before starting the project since we are querying in MySQL and the data should be in a readable format for MySQL since MySQL cannot read CSV data directly.
The SQL file is the solution file which solves most of the problems given in the problem set. Some problems may have multiple solutions while some may have a single solution. 
I have also put my own spin on it by displaying some extra information in some queries eventhough it was not explicitly asked but was relevant.
